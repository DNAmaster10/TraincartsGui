A plugin which allows players to create ticket shop guis for purchasing tickets from the Traincarts plugin.

## How to use
- Run `/train ticket create <ticket name>` to create a Traincarts ticket.
- Run `/tshop ticket create <ticket name> <display name of ticket to use>` to get a "gui ticket" item.
- Run `/tshop gui create <name> <display name>` to create a shop GUI.
- Run `/tshop gui edit <name>`
- Drag the ticket you were given by the plugin into the inventory that opens.

- Run `/tshop gui open <name>` to open the shop GUI. Click on a ticket to get it in your inventory.

Right click on it to open the shop GUI.

## Linkers
Linkers are a powerful tool which allows players to "link" multiple guis together.

To get started, you must have at least two guis already created. For example, we may have run:
- `/tshop gui create mainline Mainline Tickets`
- `/tshop gui create subline Subline Tickets`

We may want to have it so that the gui `mainline` links to the second gui, `subline`.

Firstly, we must create a new "linker". To do this, we can run:
- `/tshop linker create <linked gui name> <display name>`

In our example, this would look something like:
- `/tshop linker create subline Subline Tickets`

This should give us a linker item which looks something like this:

With this new linker, we can run:
- `/tshop gui edit mainline`
  
and drag and drop the linker item anywhere within the `mainline` gui, even amongst other tickets.

Now, when a player opens the `mainline` gui, they will be able to click the linker item. This will redirect them to the `subline` gui.

It's also possible to set the destination page that a linker item will link to.

For example:
- `/tshop linker setDestinationPage 10`
  
will make it so that when the linker is clicked, it will try to redirect the player to page 10 of the destination gui.
